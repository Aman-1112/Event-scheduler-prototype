PRODUCTION üöö

same image not loaded in password reset email:
Google adds its own URL before an image URL when the email is being displayed through the Gmail web interface.
This is done as a security measure to protect users from potentially harmful images or content that may be included in emails.
When an email includes an image that is hosted on an external server, Google's proxy server will fetch the image and scan it for any potential security threats before displaying it to the user.
This helps to prevent any malicious code or viruses from being executed on the user's device when they open the email.
While this can sometimes cause issues with image rendering, it is an important security measure that helps to protect Gmail users from potential threats.
